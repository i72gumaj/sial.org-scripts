Sample scripts for applying DNS changes via nsupdate(1). Use at own
risk, etc. Not a complete solution; for more extensive changes I usually
end up freezing the zones and updating the zone data directly. This
obviously will suit sites where only a few people are making infrequent
DNS changes; more complicated needs would perhaps need a more
complicated solution.

 * Supports both IPv4 and IPV6 addresses.
 * Relies on v4addr and v6addr scripts that can be found over in the
   ../../network directory for reverse DNS calculation or IP address
   input validation.
 * The scripts will need customization, e.g. to set the default domain.
 * Output is to stderr for errors, though 'failed to' results will be
   sent to stdout, allowing for easy capture of any problems over a
   list of hosts:

     while read host ip; do create-host $host $ip; done < input > output

   And then `grep "failed to" output` if there were any errors.
 * More scripts will need to be written to support other record types,
   for sites that cannot freeze the domains for whatever reason.
