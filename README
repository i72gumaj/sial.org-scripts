Various Perl and C and Shell scripts, doubtless in no way suitable for any sort
of use whatsoever. See also https://github.com/thrig/zsh-compdef which may have
ZSH completions for some of the utilities herein. Which, again, should not be
used, except as a warning to the next ten generations.

The C code is aimed at *BSD, Mac OS X and OpenBSD in particular, and probably
assumes that at least -std=c99 is set e.g. in $CFLAGS. Much less effort is made
towards porting the C code to work on, say, Linux.

Achtung, Minen
--------------

Things may well be moved or deleted without notice. If this is a concern, copy
the bits somewhere else. Or back away. Slowly.

Porting
-------

I strongly advise against using systems that use bash, especially where /bin/sh
is actually bash, in which case setting LC_COLLATE=C and such may be mandatory
in various shell scripts, or to just not use shell scripts.

A Historical Missive
--------------------

This ragged bundle of bits began as a CVS repository, not less than a few years
ago. At one point, it was briefly migrated to Subversion, but that ended in
disaster when the Subversion database wedged--something about BDB and Mac OS X,
who knows. One can find traces of this event in the history. Anyways, it was
back to CVS for a while longer, until eventually I moved to git, that being the
fashionable thing for Perl folks to do, or so I hear. git has yet to blow up on
me, which I suppose is nice.

LICENSE
-------

Using the ISC license now because putting things into the public domain is uh
probably not possible given the present style of attaching onions to belts.
